Project gitlab repository
-------------------------

This is the initial template of your project's gitlab
repository. Place the implementation in **src** directory. In addition
to source files, there should be **Makefile** for easy building of the
project (or equivalent, if you are not using C or C++).

**doc** directory is reserved for documentation, in case you are using
  e.g. Latex for documentation. git works best with lightweight text
  files, but submitting e.g. Word binaries should work as well. You
  don't need to use this directory. Your group may decide to use
  cloud-based document solutions for better collaboration.

**Do not add files that are generated from source** to git. For example,
you should not add C object files or the executable binary. Neither should
you add pdf version of your document.

Apart from src directory, you can modify the directory structure in
this repository as you wish, and also update this README file with
information specific to your project.
